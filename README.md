## Motivation

> The memory card game is an oft recommended coding project. I wanted to push the project and my learning further by featuring a multiplayer head-to-head mode. 

## Description

> Card Race is a memory card game where players match pairs of like cards in a random deck. In single player mode, players race against the clock. Players can submit high scores at the end of the game. Multiplayer mode allows players to race head-to-head against an opponent. The first player to match all of their cards wins.
